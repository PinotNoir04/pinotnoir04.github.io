Hey everyone, It&rsquo;s me again, back with the final update for this year&rsquo;s Season of KDE. So, turns out things don&rsquo;t really go as planned and it took me some extra time to bring it over the line.
Since my last post, I wrote the tests for the Kalah game, the associated TUI, a greedy move selection and benchmarked Oware and Bohnenspiel. My mid-sem exams happened, in between, and delayed me by 2 weeks." />

<p>Hey everyone, It&rsquo;s me again, back with the final update for this year&rsquo;s Season of KDE. So, turns out things don&rsquo;t really go as planned and it took me some extra time to bring it over the line.</p>
<p>Since my last post, I wrote the tests for the Kalah game, the associated TUI, a greedy move selection and benchmarked Oware and Bohnenspiel. My mid-sem exams happened, in between, and delayed me by 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Writing the tests shed light on some problems with my implementation of the Kalah rules, which I quickly fixed up. Thankfully, the TUI is basically the same for the different games. The greedy algorithm was easy to implement too, owing to all the prior research done on Kalah. Finally, I ran benchmarks on Oware and Bohnenspiel to determine which player is favoured when playing optimally.</p>
<p>That concludes my term in this year&rsquo;s Season of KDE. A big thank you to my mentors, Joao &amp; Benson. I will make sure to keep contributing to KDE. :)</p>
